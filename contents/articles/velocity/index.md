Back from Velocity London. Really, really great talks. I knew some guys, not personally, from different blogs or open-source projects that I follow on regular basis, or from last year conference. But I discover some others which are really excellent.

By the way, it's not totally a discovery, Google guys were really, really impressive. Addy Osmany, Ilya Grigorik, and Paul Lewis talks and tutorials for the two firsts are pushing the web forward. I do not say that others talks where not as good. The overall quality was really high as last year. It's just my opinion. I'm a web developer with a strong engineer background and I am only saying that this talks were high level. I would say that these three ones, are from the new performance generation walking in Steve Souders's shoes. 

See you next year!
