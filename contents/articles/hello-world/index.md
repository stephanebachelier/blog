Welcome to my new blog! Exit wordpress and all other blog engines. Don't take me wrong: I do not say they are bad. I just say they are too complicated to setup or maintain. My previous blog was on Wordpress. But this lead me to simply barely write any article. 

I want something simple,
 * no database
 * no server administration
 * no more login
 * no more update
 * no more plugin mess
 * no more potential blog hack or server hack in most severe cases
 * no more caching issue
 * etc
 
Instead :
 * write in markdown as I now exclusively use this language to write anything technical related.
 * use CSS for preentation
 * only generated static files
 * deploy in one click on any server

Really simple.
 
And better everything into a distributed control versioned system. After CVS, SVN and Mercurial I'm now using Git. Better (for me!).

The goal is simply to return to what a blog is : share content or ideas by writing articles.

So no more headache :)

By the way why should it be another way ? A blog is simply putting 
some text, eventually an image or maybe a video or better an embed youtube|vimeo|dailymotion|... video player. Why use dynamic pages to handle this ? 

I understand that it may not be appropriate for everyone but I've explained Git to some non-technical or non-developer users to work with, and, within a few hours or so they had understood the essence of Git and were able to use, with some assistance Git. I do not say all were able to use the command line. But some Great tools exist, like SourceTree from Atlassian. No advertising here, just sharing :)

Again it's not for all users.

So after some time I found some blog engine, and as I ended to write a lot of Javascript/Coffeescript most of the time, I choose one on top of nodejs. Thus Wintersmith. Simple, efficient, extendable. Oh I forgot to mention: open-sourced.

Thus my new blog. I do not think I will keep any content from my previous blog. Why should I ? Small content, not so much interesting being mainly flash/flex oriented and some content already 4-5 years old. And no time to look at this.

And this leads me to the last point. Why a blog ? Because I think I have a lots to share with others about my work being javascript/mobile/SPA/performance related.
